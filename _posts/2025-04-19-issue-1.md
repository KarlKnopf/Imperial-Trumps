<p><strong>Galactic Week 3 day 5 Year 3895</strong></p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome To The Neighborhood! Issue 1</h1>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">What is this?</h2>
<p>Welcome To The Neighborhood! is a weekly newsletter dedicated to informing the public on anything they could possibly want to know about The Intergalactic Society! What is The Intergalactic Society? It is a movement dedicated to bringing the universe together one galaxy at a time! As of now we have over 400,000 member galaxies, with Megaska as its latest member!</p>
<p>Speaking of which, it is Megaska that we are going to write about in our first issue! This issue will cover the highlights of the galaxy to show current and future extragalactic readers what’s so great about it!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Megaska</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;">Megaska, majestically floating through the void!</p>

<p>Megaska is home to roughly 200 billion star systems, and those star systems are home to countless numbers of people and species. Humanity calls it The Milky Way, the hengowians know it as The Thing With Many Arms, but the official name of the galaxy, voted in Year 2525, is Megaska—Korgolian for "Our Home".</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Galaxy Highlights</h3>

<p><strong>Lok-Zok-Pon:</strong> A brown planet with green clouds made of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. Beneath those clouds lie vast rivers and lakes of liquid nitrogen and carbon monoxide. Despite the harsh conditions, intelligent aquatic beings known as drelltari thrive here. The Intergalactic Society helped them become technological peers through donated assistance.</p>
